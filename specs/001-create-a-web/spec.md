# Feature Specification: Web Development Portfolio Website for Aykut Spohr

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-web`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a Web Development portfolio website for Aykut Spohr (name of the developer). Tone & brand: Bold Minimalism (Please do your research on important aspects of this design language). Primary audience: small and mid-sized businesses in Germany. Primary language: German. Deliver a polished one-pager that shows trust, clarity, and clear next steps for potential clients. High-level goals: 1. Immediately communicate who I am, what services I offer, and the business value for clients. 2. Make contacting / requesting a quote easy and frictionless (prominent CTA and contact flow). 3. Must comply with German accessibility requirements (BFSG / EAA) + WCAG / EN standards. 4. One-page navigation with deep links via URL fragments: section IDs, /#sectionName style links; history & focus management so back/forward + section sharing works. 5. Include pricing section with three tiers: Landing, Standard, Custom/Contact. 6. Provide a design token set (colors, type scale, spacing), style guide. Make sure these are easy to change in case client wants changes."

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A small or mid-sized business owner in Germany visits Aykut Spohr's portfolio website to evaluate web development services. They need to quickly understand what services are offered, see evidence of quality work, understand pricing options, and easily initiate contact for a project quote. The business owner navigates through different sections to build trust and confidence before making contact.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a potential client visits the homepage, **When** they view the hero section, **Then** they immediately understand who Aykut is, what services he offers, and the value proposition for their business
2. **Given** a client wants to see previous work, **When** they navigate to the portfolio section, **Then** they can view 3 detailed case studies with problem-solution-outcome narratives and visuals
3. **Given** a client is interested in pricing, **When** they visit the pricing section, **Then** they see three clear tiers (Landing, Standard, Custom/Contact) with included features and pricing guidance
4. **Given** a client wants to request a quote, **When** they click the primary CTA or contact form, **Then** they can easily submit their information with GDPR-compliant privacy notices
5. **Given** a client uses assistive technology, **When** they navigate the site, **Then** all content is accessible via keyboard, screen reader, and meets WCAG AA standards
6. **Given** a client shares a specific section URL (e.g., /#pricing), **When** someone visits that link, **Then** the page loads and scrolls directly to that section with proper focus management
7. **Given** a client prefers dark mode, **When** they toggle the theme, **Then** their preference is saved and the site displays consistently in their chosen theme

### Edge Cases
- What happens when someone visits a non-existent section fragment URL?
- How does the contact form behave when submission fails or network issues occur?
- What displays when JavaScript is disabled but the site should remain functional?
- How does the site perform on slow connections or older devices?
